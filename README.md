- Compatibility with Android 9
- ZipPass: A new way to exchange StreetPass data through zip files
- Built in cheats
- Amiibo generation

# Installation

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/AzaharPlus/AzaharPlus/releases).

### Android

The Android build is available in 2 flavors.

- Replace: It has the same application id as Azahar, so it will replace it on the device.
Its display name is "AzaharPlus" and its icon background is blue.
Use this one if you have other apps that target Azahar, like a frontend for example.

- Coexist: It has a new application id so it can coexist with Azahar without issues.
Its display name is "+AzaharPlus+" and its icon background is red.

### Cocoon

The easiest way to use AzaharPlus with Cocoon is to uninstall Azahar and install the replace variant of AzaharPlus. It wiil be seen as Azahar by Cocoon.

### Batocera

To use AzaharPlus with Batocera you can install the Batocera Unofficial Add-ons

# ZipPass

ZipPass allows you to share StreetPass data in the form of zip files.<br>
On desktop it is in File > ZipPass. On android it is in the main menu.

- It can only be used when no game is running.
- It requires system files and LLE modules enabled.
- You need to enable StreetPass in your games.
- The export feature will save the StreetPass data of all your games in a xxx.pass.zip file.
- The import feature lets you pick one or several xxx.pass.zip files and will simulate StreetPass tags.
- You can pick as many files as you want for the import but every game has a limit for its queue and anything - beyond that will be ignored.
- This is all pretty experimental so in case of issues, I added a menu to disable StreetPass on every game. You won't lose anything, you will simply need to enable StreetPass again.
- I opened a topic on the github for people to share their data: [ZipPass Exchange](https://github.com/AzaharPlus/AzaharPlus/discussions/117)
